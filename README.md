# OpenIddict Session Management Sample

This sample application is based on the [Contruum sample](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-samples/?tab=readme-ov-file#aspnet-core-samples), but with [OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html) implemented. This sample application has been verified by running the `OpenID Connect Core: Session Management Certification Profile Authorization server test` profile in [the OIDC certification suite](https://www.certification.openid.net/).

To see the specific changes that were necessary to implement Session Management, see [commit bc842c2](https://github.com/GREsau/openiddict-session-management-sample/commit/bc842c23acc000b6069c589ff972976c0d077b95).
